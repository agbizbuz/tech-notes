# Quick Notes
- Strings have double or triple quotes
- Data Structs
  - Dictionary
  - Tuple => Immutable sequence
  - Array => Mutable sequence
- Structs
  - Immutable by default
  - Custome constructor with new Keyword
- Multiple Dispatch => functions with same name (called methods of a function) but different arguments
- Function Dispatch => Apply function to each member of a collection (like for each)
- To type a unicode character or emoji start with a '\' and name
  - e.g. \omega => omega symbol
- Variable names can't start with a number
- function arguments can be
  - default
  - positional
  - keyword => after ';'
- In Pluto.jl, get live documentation when a word is highlighted
- info functions
  - methodswith
  - typeof
  - supertype, supertypes
  - subtypes
  - isa => works also as a binary op
  - Base.summarysize => type size
  - isabstract
- Julia REPL
  - ? => help mode
  - ] => Package mode
  - ; => Shell mode
  - Backspace => Exit a mode
- Accessing elements by columns of a Matrix is faster than accessing by rows as Matrix is stored as array in memory
- naming conventions
  - CamelCase => Packages, Modules, Types
  - contineouslowercase/ snake_case => functions, variables
- Datasets
  - from R => package RDatasets
